# ============================================================================
# Dependency Review Workflow
# ============================================================================
# This workflow scans pull requests for dependency changes and identifies:
#   - Known security vulnerabilities (CVEs)
#   - Invalid or incompatible licenses
#   - Dependency supply chain risks
#
# Triggers: Pull requests to main or master branches
#
# The workflow will fail if critical vulnerabilities are detected, preventing
# potentially vulnerable code from being merged.
#
# For more information, see: CI-CD.md
